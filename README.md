# Binary Classification 
### Class Project with Kaggle HR Data

I led a two-student team effort on optimizing a binary classification problem of kaggle data: https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics-1. 

We were interested in predicting whether or not an employee leaves prematurely. We employed 11 models including various regression and tree models as well as neural networks and found the best prediction rate at 98.4% with random Forest.
